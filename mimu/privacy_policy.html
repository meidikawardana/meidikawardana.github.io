          <strong>How We Store and Protect Personal Information?</strong>
        </h3>
        <div class="paragraph-2">
          <em
            >The security of your personal information is important to us. When
            you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our
            website, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer
            technology (SSL). When Credit Card details are collected, we simply
            pass them on in order to be processed as required. We never
            permanently store complete Credit Card details.</em
          ><br /><br />We follow generally accepted industry standards to store
          and protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
          transmission and once we receive it. For example, we store personal
          information in computer storage facilities in Australia and use
          appropriate website protection measures such as firewalls and
          anti-virus software, security restrictions on access to our computer
          systems, and controlled access to our corporate premises. We are
          required to store your personal information in accordance with
          applicable law after which we take reasonable steps to destroy or
          permanently deidentify personal information when we no longer need it.
          We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to
          fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer
          retention period is required or permitted by law.<br /><br />While we
          do our best to protect personal information and the privacy of users
          of our Sites, the Internet is not a secure method of transmitting
          information so we cannot guarantee the security of any personal
          information that you disclose and you disclose that information at
          your own risk. We use secure socket layer technology (SSL) to encrypt
          credit card information so that they are securely transmitted and
          processed but we cannot and do not accept responsibility for the
          security of that information t, or for any unauthorised access or use
          of that information. We do not accept any liability for any loss or
          damage suffered by you as a result of any unauthorised access to or
          disclosure of information supplied by you over the Internet.<br />‍<br />
